# Generative-Adverserial-Network-in-PyTorch
In this project, I aim to explore the mathematical foundations and internal dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks through the implementation of the first GAN architecture proposed in 2014. I will create the model using the PyTorch library in Python and train it on the MNIST dataset.
